		<h2>Hello! My name is Kayla Hartlaub.</h2>
		<img src="PictureOfMe.jpeg" alt="Picture of Me" style="width:270px;height:420px;">
		<p class="about" style="color:black">I am a junior at UW-Madison. I am currently majoring in Consumer Behavior
 and Marketplace Studies, but I am also pursuing certificates in Digital Studies and 
 Entrepreneurship. Overcoming challenges and solving complex puzzles and problems is 
 something I am very passionate about. I enjoy building up something to it's full 
 potential and committing to making sure it continues to improve. In addition to this,
 I am a very good problem solver, as I can look at something from multiple angles and 
 am willing to try out multiple methods to reach a desired goal. I value community and 
 communication, as it not only helps me continue to have passion and devotion towards 
 my work and life but also makes me and anyone else involved comfortable while doing so.
 I am looking to work in Digital Marketing, with a focus on social media and possibly 
 website-related marketing. In my free time, my interests include traveling and spending 
 time with animals and, if possible, I would love to include these in my future career.</p>
